* Goal is to bring together a few, simple features that make for an interesting game experience, without any fancy graphics!


## Features
* Fixed top-down view
* Fun with emitting materials
* Move-n-shoot
* Healthbars
* A few simply enemy "boxes"
* A simple rule-based AI framework
* Arrow-tracking of off-screen enemies
* Dynamic LevelManager
